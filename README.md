### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Brief intro about me:
  * My Tech life started almost 3 years ago. Transitioned from `Math Teacher`  -->  `SDET` --> `DevOps Engineer`
  * Iâ€™m currently working as Test Automation Engineer, soon to start a new role as DevOps Engineer.
  * I have learnt (still keep learning :)) DevOps tools/technologies since last 6 months.
  * I love automation, coding, problem-solving and learning new skills and implement them to solve different challenges.
